    <br><br>
    <p>1. <b>Introduction</b></p><br>
    <p>Welcome to <b>Finned-tech</b> (“Company”, “we”, “our”, “us”)!</p>
    <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Terms of Service”) govern your use of our website located at
      <b>https://finned.tech</b> (together or individually “Service”) operated by <b>Finned-tech</b>.</p>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard and disclose
      information that results from your use of our web pages.</p>
    <p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy (“Agreements”). You acknowledge that you have
      read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound of them.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) Agreements, then you may not use the Service, but please let us
      know by emailing at <b>hello@finned.tech</b> so we can try to find a solution. These Terms apply to all visitors,
      users and others who wish to access or use Service.</p><br>
    <p>2. <b>Communications</b></p><br>
    <p>By using our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other
      information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by
      following the unsubscribe link or by emailing at hello@finned.tech.</p><br>
    <p>3. <b>Purchases</b></p><br>
    <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through Service (“Purchase”), you may be asked to
      supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including but not limited to, your credit or debit card
      number, the expiration date of your card, your billing address, and your shipping information.</p>
    <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any card(s) or other payment method(s) in
      connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.</p>
    <p>We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of
      Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third
      parties subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product
      or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or
      other reasons.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is
      suspected.</p><br>
    <p>4. <b>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</b></p>
    <p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) made available through Service may be
      governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of Service. If you participate in any Promotions, please
      review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms
      of Service, Promotion rules will apply.</p><br>
    <p>5. <b>Subscriptions</b><br></p>
    <p>Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a
      recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles will be set depending on the type of subscription
      plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions
      unless you cancel it or Finned-tech cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
      your online account management page or by contacting hello@finned.tech customer support team.</p>
    <p>A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Finned Ad
      Services with accurate and complete billing information that may include but not limited to full name, address,
      state, postal or zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment
      information, you automatically authorize Finned-tech to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your
      account to any such payment instruments.</p>
    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Finned-tech reserves the right to terminate your
      access to the Service with immediate effect.</p><br>
    <p>6. <b>Free Trial</b><br></p>
    <p>Finned-tech may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of
      time ("Free Trial").</p>
    <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.</p>
    <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by Finned Ad
      Services until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your
      Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you
      have selected.</p>
    <p>At any time and without notice, Finned-tech reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free
      Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p><br>
    <p>7. <b>Fee Changes</b><br></p>
    <p>Finned-tech, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions.
      Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
    <p>Finned-tech will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you
      an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay
      the modified Subscription fee amount.</p><br>
    <p>8. <b>Refunds</b><br></p>
    <p>We issue refunds for Contracts within <b>14 days</b> of the original purchase of the Contract.</p><br>
